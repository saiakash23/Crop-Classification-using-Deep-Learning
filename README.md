# Crop Classification using Deep-Learning

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify crops using Inception and VGG-16 models. It's designed to accurately identify various crop types from images, enhancing agricultural research and automation.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes transfer learning with Inception and VGG-16 architectures, pretrained on ImageNet.
- **Data Augmentation:** Augments training data with flips and rotations, improving model robustness.
- **Model Training:** Fine-tunes the pretrained models on a custom dataset of crop images.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance with metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- **Visualization:** Visualizes model training progress with loss and accuracy plots.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or in a cloud environment like Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure Python 3.6+ and necessary libraries are installed.
   - Use a virtual environment for better isolation:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Prepare Dataset:**
   - Organize your crop images into train and test directories.
   - Update paths in the code to match your dataset structure.

4. **Train the Models:**
   - Adjust parameters like epochs and batch size in `train.py`.
   - Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```

5. **Evaluate Model:**
   - After training, evaluate model performance on test data.
   - Check classification reports and confusion matrices to assess accuracy.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy your trained model using frameworks like Flask or Django for production use.
   - Integrate with a web or mobile application for real-time crop classification.

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy of **90%** on the test set after **40 epochs** of training.
- Confusion matrix and classification report are available in the `results` directory.
